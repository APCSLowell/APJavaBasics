			<h1>AP Java: a Basic Java Program</h1>
		</header>
<p>You've written programs before in some language like JavaScript or Python. In many ways Java programming is similar, but you will
	notice immediately
	that the basic Java "Hello, World!" program looks pretty confusing and complicated. Here's a Java program that prints 
	"Hello, World!". Press the <em>Run</em> button and the program output should appear to the right of the code in what is called
	the <em>console</em>.

<p>Luckily though, one line of code is much more important and interesting than all the rest. For now we are just interested in 
	<h2><xmp>System.out.println("Hello, World!");</xmp></h2>
	and we will ignore everything else. This line of code an example of a Java <em>statement</em>. If we think of Java as a language like
	English, a <em>statement</em> is like a sentence. The same way a period ends an English sentence, a semi-colon marks the end of
        of a Java statement.
<p><code>"Hello World!"</code> is an example of a Java <code>String</code>. A <code>String</code> is a collection of letters, digits,
	punctuation and/or spaces. The beginning and end of the String are marked with <em>double quotes</em> <code>"</code>.
	
	<h2><code>print()</code> vs <code>println()</code></h2>
<p><code>System.out.println()</code> prints first and inserts a line break so that <em>whatever is printed next
	is printed on the next line</em>. Run the following code and you'll notice top and bottom are printed on separate lines.
