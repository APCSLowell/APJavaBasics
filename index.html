			<h1>AP Java: a Basic Java Program</h1>
		</header>
		<p>You've written programs before in some language like JavaScript or Python. In many ways Java programming is similar, but you will
			notice immediately
			that the basic Java "Hello, World!" program looks pretty confusing and complicated. Here's a Java program that prints 
			"Hello, World!". Press the <em>Run</em> button and the program output should appear to the right of the code in what is called
			the <em>console</em>.

		<p>Luckily though, one line of code is much more important and interesting than all the rest. For now we are just interested in 
		<h2><xmp>System.out.println("Hello, World!");</xmp></h2>
		and we will ignore everything else. This line of code an example of a Java <em>statement</em>. If we think of Java as a language like
			English, a <em>statement</em> is like a sentence. The same way a period ends an English sentence, a semi-colon marks the end of
        		of a Java statement.
		<p><code>"Hello World!"</code> is an example of a Java <code>String</code>. A <code>String</code> is a collection of letters, digits,
			punctuation and/or spaces. The beginning and end of the String are marked with <em>double quotes</em> <code>"</code>.
	
		<h2><code>print()</code> vs <code>println()</code></h2>
		<p><code>System.out.println()</code> prints first and inserts a <em>newline</em> so that <em>whatever is printed next
			is printed on the next line</em>. Run the following code and you'll notice top and bottom are printed on separate lines.

		<p>Java has another printing function. <code>System.out.print()</code> which does NOT insert a <em>newline</em>.
			Change the first statement to <code>System.out.print("Top");</code> And make sure that "Bottom" is printed on the same line as "Top".
		<p>Now change the second statement to <code>System.out.print("Bottom");</code> and notice that the output doesnâ€™t change
			since nothing is printed after "Bottom".
		
		<h2>Escape Characters</h2>
		
		<p>Escape characters are special symbols in Java that begin with a backslash <code>\</code>
			A good way to remember the difference between a backslash and a forward slash is that a backslash leans backwards ( \ ),
			while a forward slash leans forward ( / ). The Java escape charater for newline is <code>\n</code>. Run the following
			code and you'll see "Top" and "Bottom" on separate lines.

		<p>Other escape charaters are:
		<ul><li><code>\t</code> Insert a tab in the text at this point
		<li><code>\'</code> Insert a single quote in the text at this point
		<li><code>\"</code> Insert a double quote in the text at this point
		<li><code>\\</code> Insert a backslash in the text at this point
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Arithmetic and expressions</h2>

		<h2>Four 4s challenge</h2>
		<p>Use exactly four 4's to write an expression that evaluates to every integer from 1 to 10, using only + - * / and ().
		No decimals, factorials, square roots, exponents, or other symbols are allowed. The first one has alreday been done 
		for you. Submit the link to your finished program by choosing <em>Share | Link</em>. Go to Google Classroom and
		and then choose	<em>Add Link</em> for the assignment.
